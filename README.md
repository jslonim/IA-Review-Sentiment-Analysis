# IA-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

This is a simple IA that was trained with a dataset of 50K movie reviews for Sentiment Analysis.

There is a console that you can use to enter a review yourself and the IA will tell you if it's a Positive or a Negative Statement.

With enough traning this kind of IA could be good at detecting Toxicity Online or read the sentiment among any topic.
